Sipher Web Academy: in terms of the frequency distribution.

191
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:58.780
Sipher Web Academy: something like, they say, basically MoD more upon total and

192
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.070
Sipher Web Academy: board upon total

193
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.680
Sipher Web Academy: done.

208
00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:36.780
Sipher Web Academy: Top 10 formula. Typical, sir. Idf.

209
00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:52.590
Sipher Web Academy: Equal to idea, for the term idea for the term can be calculated by idea, for the term can be calculated by Sir Log of log of total number of frequency. Sorry. Total number of the documents.

210
00:56:55.790 --> 00:57:04.240
Sipher Web Academy: Total number of the documents divided by Loganda Re.

211
00:57:04.818 --> 00:57:17.760
Sipher Web Academy: Like the account you get divided by one plus number of documents containing entem containing end terms.

212
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:21.630
Sipher Web Academy: Dig it

213
00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:29.219
Sipher Web Academy: so total number of documents divided by one plus number of documents containing number of documents containing such terms.

214
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:44.010
Sipher Web Academy: Example, malloc. If you have 1,000 documents, yeah.

215

Sipher Web Academy: Clear air give is the amendment. Got them birthday? Aga.

327
01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:06.610
Sipher Web Academy: abjatha. Very, very important, this economy world to work word to. Vec world 2 web training.

328
01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:16.340
Sipher Web Academy: You get world to work. Basically, is it training and custom corpus.

329
01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.610
Sipher Web Academy: vector we both think custom corpus.

330
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:29.020
Sipher Web Academy: Vector okay, basically, it's good training model could train Carnegie use case. This is used for training purpose. Also.

331
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:38.180
Sipher Web Academy: digger, or is me, basically, I'm looking both popular package. That means we have a package called as

332
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:44.000
Sipher Web Academy: Guinness Cake package.

333
01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.099
Sipher Web Academy: Take a Gen. Jen Simkar, K.

334
01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:53.590
Sipher Web Academy: Jen SIM, they get Jen. I don't know Gen. Sime. A good choice. Also airports dense.

335
01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.920
Sipher Web Academy: Then symbol to bet. Yeah.

336
01:18:57.310 --> 01:19:02.880
Sipher Web Academy: So yavo package, basically embedding spaganda, banana, kamata, Gen. SIM ticket.

337
01:19:03.010 --> 01:19:11.010
Sipher Web Academy: the kind of topic modeling for human. So basically, world to web embedding.

338
01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:19.160
Sipher Web Academy: So dedicated packages, Yoki is, do you get?

339
01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:26.249
Sipher Web Academy: So it's my concept in this also.

340
01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.270
Sipher Web Academy: In this concept, also.

341
01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:34.570
Sipher Web Academy: we try to convert.

342
01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:38.820
Sipher Web Academy: We are trying to convert

343
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:55.520
Sipher Web Academy: the text. 2 vectors take a textbook distribution package. Use Gen. SIM, package digger.

344
01:19:56.110 --> 01:20:01.340
Sipher Web Academy: have a cookie ginseng package here. So definitely, you need to what download this

345
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:12.059
Sipher Web Academy: ticket definitely, you need to download this. So Jensen package download ticket it's called Rokunga.

346
01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.840
Sipher Web Academy: or Yahabar may open Garunga code. Dot

347

Sipher Web Academy: World 2 Vec.

355
01:24:21.830 --> 01:25:11.559
Sipher Web Academy: Pre-trained model, but Lugi pre-trained, worldwide, pre-trained models pre-trained models who think

356
01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.090
Sipher Web Academy: wo pre-trained models. 1.5 Gb's.

357
01:25:17.650 --> 01:25:21.630
Sipher Web Academy: It's a Jada yoga plus 1.5. Gb's

358
01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.402

359
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:51.040
Sipher Web Academy: 1.5 Gb's Gb Kahoga it's. A heavy model. Ota, basically Otm to easily pre-trained model use.

360
01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:56.510
Sipher Web Academy: World 2, vec, take a world to Vec training.

361
01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:02.570
Sipher Web Academy: Yeah. Custom corpus method. We both explore map already. But convert to

362
01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.779
Sipher Web Academy: vector word, to vector word to Vec

363
01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:21.420
Sipher Web Academy: world 2, Vec, also called as custom vectorization custom, vector, yeah, custom Corpus, vector, custom corpus, vector.

364
01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:31.890
Sipher Web Academy: okay, multiple Lamen, Yadar Kiga, do. You guys were to Vec

365

Sipher Web Academy: training corpus custom corpus training custom corpus.

366
01:26:51.490 --> 01:27:07.469
Sipher Web Academy: vector, okay, is co converter down me, that's it from Jen SIM ticket from Gensim dot models.

367
01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:12.480
Sipher Web Academy: Gensim dot models import world. 2 Vec.

368
01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:18.509
Sipher Web Academy: World, 2 world cup W. Capital ownership world. 2 week cup v. Capital, 1 2 week.

Sipher Web Academy: Yeah.

373
01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:47.010
Sipher Web Academy: Gensim dot model. Say, yes, from Gensim dot models import world to vec, say, yes, import over

374
01:27:47.320 --> 01:28:06.550
Sipher Web Academy: up import. Basically downloader. Api downloader. Api Ota Karta Repository as

375
01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:13.439
Sipher Web Academy: download. Yeah. As as like secure D Api D Api downloader Api.

Sipher Web Academy: The Api, hey, Gabe.

378
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:33.620
Sipher Web Academy: the Api. So basically Api, so Gen SIM downloader, basically downloader.

379
01:28:33.800 --> 01:29:03.109
Sipher Web Academy: Given model download gensim downloader as Api

380
01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:19.020
Sipher Web Academy: sentences may basically a double list. Gonga individual individual level

381
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:22.779
Sipher Web Academy: to get those 3 Memolalia learning

382
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:31.359
Sipher Web Academy: is funelia than a corpus next.

383
01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:40.870
Sipher Web Academy: Nlp comma is a

384
01:29:43.910 --> 01:30:01.869
Sipher Web Academy: good part of 8 off generative comma AI done next.

385
01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:14.930
Sipher Web Academy: Pierre Mca, dalunga world. 2 Vec were too wet creates

386
01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:25.520
Sipher Web Academy: world 2 vector embeddings

387
01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:33.000
Sipher Web Academy: vector embeddings together, too many as opposed to sentences. When I

388
01:30:45.560 --> 01:31:19.699
Sipher Web Academy: actually, for example, accessible world to work.

389
01:31:20.290 --> 01:31:57.640
Sipher Web Academy: world to make or is, may basically puts options, multi-threading, multi-course hotel

390
01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:05.749
Sipher Web Academy: multicore. So there, or her process. K, under multiple multiple threads. Otay threads are basically lightweight processes

391
01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:26.440
Sipher Web Academy: is vector, size bohot. But key vector, threads may execute.

392
01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:32.320
Sipher Web Academy: You know, threats. Vectors.

393
01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.510
Sipher Web Academy: Ya, as in book

394
01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:53.389
Sipher Web Academy: God, you have a copy. The letter sentences use kurunga, yawa

395
01:32:55.950 --> 01:33:04.919
Sipher Web Academy: vector, size lay around window 5, lay around minimum count, one layout or workers for char layout workers. Kamala, both are threats.

396
01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:11.650
Sipher Web Academy: Workers come across basically multi-threading Karao.

397
01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:18.220

Sipher Web Academy: Do you get?

403
01:33:57.630 --> 01:34:13.790
Sipher Web Academy: They can you see, you have basically vector, scientific notation, eq, power, 3,

404
01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:24.930
Sipher Web Academy: Ak vector size, a is Ak vector computation, computation, value exponents which are here

405
01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:33.370
Sipher Web Academy: scientific notation, something like 6.3 3 dot dot dot 10 to the power of 0 3.

406
01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:55.810
Sipher Web Academy: Dig in model sev, dig in model. Say, both dig it.

407
01:34:57.730 --> 01:35:01.350
Sipher Web Academy: Hear the model. Sebo.

408
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.069
Sipher Web Academy: Okay, the app is called safe, constructive. Okay? I say, safe, conceptual

409
01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:33.579
Sipher Web Academy: negili saving the model, how to save the model, so that we need not to perform

410
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:46.940
Sipher Web Academy: same same methods. Yeah. Same steps again, ready to use Chatana.

411
01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:58.300
